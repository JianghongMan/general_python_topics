#### Setup Instructions - 

1. Fork this repo
2. Run __northwind.sql__ first and then __northwind-data.sql__ in MySQLWorkbench to setup the database. The structure of the database or the EER model can be found in __northwind-erd.pdf__.
3. Run __practice_questions.sql__ to review questions from the session
4. More questions for this database can be found in __SQL Practice Problems.pdf__ (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1r9xOPoS1yyKe5DoJJmRh33ubaJrzkz0w) 

#### Note - The database referred in the book and the database above are exactly same in structure but not in terms of observations. Be cognizant of that when checking answers with the textbook.
